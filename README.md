# Reformat-Rhea-JSON-dataset
reformats the JSON files from the Rhea dataset into a reaction SMILES and protein sequences JSON file

requies
positive.json file that contains protein uniprot IDs and Rhea reaction IDs
negative.json file that contains protein uniprot IDs and Rhea reaction IDs
uniprot_dict.json file that contains protein uniprot IDs and their sequences 
rhea_dict.json file that contains reaction SMILES and their Rhea IDs
